# **What is an Urban Heat Island?**

## **UHI Definition**

-   A UHI ("Urban Heat Island") occurs when a city experiences much warmer temperatures than nearby rural areas.

## **3 Cities for UHI Comparison**

# **Datasets**

## **Data Collection**

1.  Three datasets for the year 2022 were obtained from the [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/local-climatological-data?pageNum=1&bbox=32.843,-97.215,32.629,-97.001), then combined into one major dataset.

## Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

1.  Inspect the Data
2.  Handle Missing Values
3.  Deal with Outliers
4.  Normalize Data
5.  Ensure Temporal Integrity

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   Conduct EDA to identify patterns and relationships in the climatic data.

-   This can include visualizations like time series plots, histograms, and scatter plots to understand temperature trends, humidity levels, etc.

## Feature Engineering

Create new features that could better represent UHI effects, such as calculating temperature differences between day and night, urban and rural areas, or creating indices that combine multiple climatic variables.

# Model Selection, Training, & Validation

## Model Selection

For classification, algorithms like decision trees, random forests, or SVMs

## Model Training and Validation

Train your models on a portion of the data and validate their performance using another portion.

## Model Evaluation

Use metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall for classification models, to evaluate their performance on a test set.

## Interpretation of Results

Interpret the model outcomes in the context of UHI effects. Analyze which features are most important in predicting UHI intensity and how different climatic variables interact with urbanization.
