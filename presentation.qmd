# **What is an Urban Heat Island?**

## **UHI Definition**

-   A UHI ("Urban Heat Island") occurs when a city experiences much warmer temperatures than nearby rural areas.

## **3 Cities for UHI Comparison**

Dallas vs. Arlington vs. Denton

# **Datasets**

## **Data Collection**

1.  Three datasets for the year 2022 were obtained from the [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/local-climatological-data?pageNum=1&bbox=32.843,-97.215,32.629,-97.001), then combined into one major dataset.

## Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

1.  Inspect the Data
2.  Handle Missing Values
3.  Deal with Outliers
4.  Normalize Data
5.  Ensure Temporal Integrity

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1.  Conduct EDA to identify patterns and relationships in the climatic data.

2.  This can include visualizations like time series plots, histograms, and scatter plots to understand temperature trends, humidity levels, etc.

# Feature Engineering

## Create Seasonal Thresholds

Create and separate the data by "Seasons" and then create thresholds for each season based on the following weather conditions:

1.  Hourly Dry Bulb Temperature

2.  Hourly Relative Humidity

3.  Hourly Wind Speed

## Feature Engineering

Design a classification function to label UHI intensities for hourly weather data.

``` python
def classify_uhi(row, temp_thresholds, humidity_thresholds, wind_speed_thresholds):
    season = row['Season']
    temp = row['HourlyDryBulbTemperature']
    humidity = row['HourlyRelativeHumidity']
    wind_speed = row['HourlyWindSpeed']

    # Get the thresholds for the current season
    temp_high = temp_thresholds.loc[season, 0.50]
    temp_medium = temp_thresholds.loc[season, 0.25]
    humidity_low = humidity_thresholds.loc[season, 0.25]
    wind_speed_low = wind_speed_thresholds.loc[season, 0.25]

    # Classify based on combined criteria
    if temp > temp_high and humidity < humidity_low and wind_speed < wind_speed_low:
        return 'High'
    elif temp > temp_medium:
        return 'Medium'
    else:
        return 'Low'
```

## Results of Classification Function

# Classification Model Selection, Training, & Validation

## Model Selection

Developed 5 classification models:

1.  Decision Tree

2.  Random Forest

3.  XGBoost

4.  SVM Classifier

## Model Training and Validation

Train your models on a portion of the data and validate their performance using another portion.

## Model Evaluation

Use metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall for classification models, to evaluate their performance on a test set.

## Interpretation of Results

Interpret the model outcomes in the context of UHI effects. Analyze which features are most important in predicting UHI intensity and how different climatic variables interact with urbanization.
